## Introduction

The OP_NET Transaction Builder library allows you to create and sign transactions for the OP_NET network. Written in
TypeScript, this library provides a comprehensive set of functions to facilitate the creation, reading, and manipulation
of OP_NET transactions, smart contracts, and other OP_NET-related technologies.

You can create any sort of transaction, and you don't have to bother about managing signer types or anything
complicated.
